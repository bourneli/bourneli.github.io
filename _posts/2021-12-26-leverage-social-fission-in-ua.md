title: Leverage Social Fission for User Acquisition
categories: [SNS, Facebook, Meta, Google, UA]

I am quarantining at a hotel in Shenzhen right now. So, I have time to summarize my experience on global user acquisition.  We have optimized the objectives of campaigns in the past decades of months on google UAC 2.5. We found that the retention of users did increase, even better than the Firebase events, but the volume did not. After serval rounds of brainstorm, We decided to improve the volume of new users by focusing on social fission. 

We have taken several trials in google UAC 2.5 with optimized social events, and the online metrics show an impressive lift, even better than the previously optimized events. This makes us believe that social fission does work in real life. So, we decided to try this on Facebook and its relative media, such as Instagram, Messager, and Whatsapp.

We made a four-stage plan to leverage the entirely social fission systematically. 

1. Be fully optimizing the social events in Google and Meta(Facebook).
2. Make customized online metrics with advertisement vendors and MMP to evaluate the actual social fission lift. It is worth pointing out that it's better to include all vendors, not only Meta.
3. Motivate users to acquire new installs with rewards. If stage-1 and stage-2 are proven to work, we speculate that rewards can amplify the effect. 
4. Build our social fission system. We will exploit our social fission strategy in all media with our invitation system so that the advertisement platforms will not limit us.

I recorded the strategy in a very high perspective. So, it would be difficult for you to understand if you are not familiar with concepts in user acquisition. After several months, I will review the strategy, which would be very exciting and anticipated.
