I was born in Wuhan, Hubei province, and left Wuhan at the age of 23, and came to Shenzhen alone to intern and work until now. I work at Tencent under the fancy name **bourneli**, known as **2rd Bro** for my "not bad performance" with **Guan Yu** in King of Glory. My job title is Senior Researcher in Applied Research, but I always consider myself a machine learning engineer.

In Sep. 2021, after 10 years working in Tencent Shenzhen Headquarter, I came to Singapore alone again to begin a new career, in which I am the pioneer to explore the global game markets for Tencent IEG Global business.
